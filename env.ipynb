    "**Goal:** Use `data/prices_returns.csv` to simulate trading with portfolio weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What to build (minimum)\n",
    "1. **Load data**\n",
    "   - Read `data/prices_returns.csv`.\n",
    "   - Pivot to a matrix `R` of shape `[T, A]` (rows=dates, cols=assets).\n",
    "   - Keep `dates` and `assets` lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Environment class**\n",
    "   - `__init__(R, dates, assets, window=20, cost_bps=10.0, include_cash=True)`\n",
    "   - `reset(seed=0)` → set `t=window`, start with equal weights, return last `window` rows of `R` as the observation `(window, A)`.\n",
    "   - `step(action)` →\n",
    "     - Softmax the action → weights that sum to 1 (long-only).\n",
    "     - Compute reward = `weights · returns_today − (cost_bps/1e4)*0.5*sum(|w_t − w_{t-1}|)`.\n",
    "     - Advance one day, return `(next_obs, reward, done, info)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Testing helpers**\n",
    "   - `equal_weight_policy(n_assets)` and `random_policy(n_assets, seed)`.\n",
    "   - `rollout(env, policy_fn, out_csv=\"data/returns_EQW.csv\")` to write daily portfolio returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Checks\n",
    "- Observation shape is always `(window, A)`.\n",
    "- After softmax: weights sum to 1 and are non-negative.\n",
    "- No NaNs in observations or rewards.\n",
    "- Equal-weight rollout produces a sensible return series (dates contiguous).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Done when\n",
    "- `TradingEnv` runs from start to finish with the equal-weight policy.\n",
    "- `data/returns_EQW.csv` is created with columns `date, ret`.\n"
