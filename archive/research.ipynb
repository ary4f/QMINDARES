    "#### A) Modeling ideas (code + reading)\n",
    "- **Momentum families:** simple lookback (42/63/84d), risk-adjusted momentum, cross-sectional vs time-series.\n",
    "- **Mean-Variance variants:** rolling 252d μ/Σ, shrinkage covariances (Ledoit-Wolf), long-only simplex projection.\n",
    "- **Risk Parity / Vol targeting:** inverse-vol, equal risk contribution; monthly vs daily rebalance.\n",
    "- **Kelly-style scaling:** μ/σ² caps; compare to risk parity.\n",
    "- **RL stubs (env-agnostic for now):** PPO/A2C/TD3 wrappers skeleton; fixed seeds; save daily returns.\n",
    "- **Observation design:** returns-only vs simple features (rolling vol, z-scores) — argue pros/cons.\n",
    "- **Action design:** long-only softmax vs allowing a CASH sleeve or leverage (research trade-offs).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### B) Finance + market micro (short, useful)\n",
    "- **Transaction costs:** sensitivity curve Sharpe vs bps; turnover analysis.\n",
    "- **Rebalance cadence:** daily vs monthly — effect on Sharpe/turnover.\n",
    "- **Regime overlays:** rolling vol “turbulence” → go-to-cash rule; thresholds that make sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### C) Evaluation & selection (apples-to-apples)\n",
    "- **Metrics:** Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar, Omega, MaxDD, Turnover, Hit rate.\n",
    "- **Selector Lab:** rolling **Sharpe vs Sortino vs Calmar**; month-end switching; min-hold rules.\n",
    "- **Stat tests:** bootstrap CI for (Strategy − SPY) or (Strategy − EQW) mean daily return.\n",

    "#### You're encourged to use the notebook we already created and build off of it and create your own mini project to test ideas. \n"
